You can preview your pdf file while you are editing the name. There are three options to help you with that new name. Two inputs and one list of options. The first input is a Date picker that will generate a name in the next format of date: yyyMMdd. For the second one, it will append the input value like this: ID_value. The extra option will be append to the new name as it is in the list. The list is editable, so you can put what you want. All of three options are appended toghether with an underscore. Finally, you can still keep editing the name of the file until you press the Rename button.

You will press Next button to skip renaming a file. The files that's been renamed will be saved in the same directory, so there will be a BoxMessage for those with the same name in that directory.
